Parallax has finally released a complete system package for the Arlo: [https://www.parallax.com/product/28966](https://www.parallax.com/product/28966)

If you've been thinking of building one, it has gotten a lot easier now with the complete package. In fact my "parts list" dropped from a dizzying grocery list to essentially 3 items: [https://github.com/chrisl8/ArloBot/wiki/Parts-List](https://github.com/chrisl8/ArloBot/wiki/Parts-List)

Also, TurtleBot is experimenting with a new 3D sensor to replace the Kinect/Xtion: [http://discourse.ros.org/t/new-depth-sensor-orbbec-astra-call-for-testing/252/1](http://discourse.ros.org/t/new-depth-sensor-orbbec-astra-call-for-testing/252/1)

This should also help with sourcing parts as those have gotten harder and harder to find.
