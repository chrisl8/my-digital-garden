(Note: This is a **very old** post, you probably want to be at [About This Site](About%20This%20Site.md) instead.)

"He's just this guy, you know?"

The primary project I talk about here is my [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) based robot built on a [Parallax Arlo](https://www.parallax.com/product/arlo-robotic-platform-system) platform.  
If you want to know more about that start here:
[ArloBot Build Index](ArloBot%20Build%20Index.md)
or
Check out some of my [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh8M2pMkX0MLl1QRnE8JrlA).

Computers have been my hobby and passion since childhood. My hobby is to experiment with computers. My goal here is to share some of my projects for those who are interested and who may want to try some of these things themselves.

I love explaining things and teaching, so if you want more direction on how to make something work do comment and I will elaborate.

I have a full time job, but if you think I'm brilliant and want to pay me good money to experiment with computers for your company then feel free to contact me. :)

If you want a little background:  
I have been a Full Stack Web Developer for about five years.  
I was a Unix System Admin for ten years before that.  
Before that I did Desktop Support for about five years.  
And back in the days of yore I helped run a small ISP.  
In short, I am a jack of all (computer) trades, and master of none.
