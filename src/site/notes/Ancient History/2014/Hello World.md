# System.out.print(“Hello World!”)

This blog is for me to share some of the experiments I do on my own time.

I will throw up some pictures and descriptions over the next few days of some of my past projects and then put updates about what I'm currently doing.

I am a Unix System Admin by trade. I am working on a degree in Web Development. I am teaching myself Java. And I like to play with computers. :)
