*Posted: November 27, 2014*

Along with my [Arlobot](https://github.com/chrisl8/ArloBot) [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) packages, I have also been working on a "[Metatron](https://github.com/chrisl8/Metatron)" package that I use for some "personalization" of my robot, and a web interface called [Arloweb](https://github.com/chrisl8/Arloweb).

I now have [Metatron](https://github.com/chrisl8/Metatron) and [Arloweb](https://github.com/chrisl8/Arloweb) on my [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisl8) repository, so technically everything I use on my robot is on [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisl8) now. In theory, if you follow my build to build the same robot I did, you can install everything from my [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisl8) repo and have a robot identical to mine. Certainly more documentation is due, but at least it is all there and being updated as I modify the code.

If there is something in particular you want to do, let me know and I'll try to document that ASAP. As it stands now I kind of drift back and forth between documenting things I did months ago and things I'm working on now.
