I had a few spare hours over the holiday season so far to do some cleanup and add a few goodies I picked up from [Parallax](http://www.parallax.com/ "Parallax") during their [sales](http://forums.parallax.com/showthread.php/158256-BIG-Sale-on-www.parallax.com "Parallax Sales").

I'll write more about my additions soon.
