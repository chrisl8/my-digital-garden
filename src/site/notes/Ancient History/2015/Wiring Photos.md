Please see this Parallax forum post for a good diagram of how to wire the HB-25's, motors and encoders: [http://forums.parallax.com/showthread.php/153150-Arlo-Batteries-and-Charging?p=1234335&viewfull=1#post1234335](http://forums.parallax.com/showthread.php/153150-Arlo-Batteries-and-Charging?p=1234335&viewfull=1#post1234335)

It is worth looking at the ActivityBot setup too: [http://learn.parallax.com/activitybot/electrical-connections](http://learn.parallax.com/activitybot/electrical-connections) which explains the server connections, which are also used for the motor controllers, and the use of pull-up resistors.

Also this thread has some good information on the the "ActivityBot"code that I use to control the motors: [http://forums.parallax.com/showthread.php/152636-Run-ActivityBot-C-Code-in-the-Arlo!](http://forums.parallax.com/showthread.php/152636-Run-ActivityBot-C-Code-in-the-Arlo!)

TODO: Write up a full wiring description with diagrams of every component . . .

The rest is just a collection of high resolution photos of the robot's wiring. I hope these may help others imagine how to wire their ArloBot!

Click on each image for a full resolution version. Download them as you see fit and if you build a wiring diagram of your own please let me link to it! Or I can host it of course if you want.
