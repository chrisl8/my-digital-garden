*Posted: December 24, 2015*

I've been over committed lately between work, education and family. So poor robot has been neglected. I'm taking some time out for a needed break and hopefully starting the new year with more free time for hobbies. For now I'm focusing on the important stuff.

(I guess the signal from so long ago and far away is having trouble getting through.)

I have a list of things to try next year though, so I'll be back soon I hope.
