I just now saw that the debs for ROS Indigo Turtlebot are listed in the [install instructions](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Installation "ROS Indigo Turtlebot Setup") now!

I have updated the [ROS Kinetic Setup](ROS%20Kinetic%20Setup.md) article to describe installation using the Turtlebot Deb packages.
