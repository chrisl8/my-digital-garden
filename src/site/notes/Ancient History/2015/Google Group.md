*Posted: October 28, 2015*

I just set up a Google Group mailing list atÂ [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ros-for-arlobot](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ros-for-arlobot)

My hope is that with this we can:

- Eliminate myself as the clearing house for all communication.
- Publicly document issues we discuss.
- Make it easier for users to help each other instead of relying mostly on me.
