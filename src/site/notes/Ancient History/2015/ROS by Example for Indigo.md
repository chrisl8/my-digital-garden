One of the motivations for building my robot was to be able to follow the tutorials and examples made for and written by ROS experts.

One of the best resources for ROS is [ROS By Example - Volume 1 by R. Patrick Goebel](http://www.lulu.com/shop/r-patrick-goebel/ros-by-example-indigo-volume-1/ebook/product-22015937.html "ROS By Example INDIGO"). I've been waiting though for the "Indigo" version to be complete, because working with documents aimed at older versions of ROS is frustrating and time consuming.

Now it is here! [http://www.pirobot.org/wordpress/indigo-revision-of-ros-by-example-volume-1-available/](http://www.pirobot.org/wordpress/indigo-revision-of-ros-by-example-volume-1-available/ "ROS By Example INDIGO Announcement")

I plan to purchase this book and work through it with my ArloBot to become more familiar with ROS and learn to add more functionality to my robot.
