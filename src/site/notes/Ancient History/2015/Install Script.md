**There is now a script to install everything.** [Laptop Setup for ROS Kinetic](Laptop%20Setup%20for%20ROS%20Kinetic.md)

Then just run this script:

bash <(wget -qO- --no-cache https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisl8/ArloBot/master/setup.sh)

and you are done!

To update your code just run the same script again and it will pull down and compile anything new without erasing custom settings.

After that you'll just need to edit the config files as noted by the script, and then set up your [Propeller Code for Arlobot (SimpleIDE Version)](Propeller%20Code%20for%20Arlobot%20(SimpleIDE%20Version).md)

As always, please let me know if you find any problems!
