In the last article I explained how to set up an Ubuntu laptop for use by ROS. Here I'm posting my notes about how to get ROS Noetic up and running on that laptop.

**There is now a script to install everything.**  
Just run:

`bash <(wget -qO- --no-cache https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisl8/ArloBot/noetic/setup-noetic.sh)`

and you are done!

To update your code just run the same script again and it will pull down and compile anything new without erasing custom settings.

NEXT!  
**Next weâ€™ll want set up [[PropWare Version)](Propeller Code for Arlobot (PropWare Version\|Propeller Code for Arlobot (PropWare Version)]].md)**
