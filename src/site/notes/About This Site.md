These are the voyages of the Voidship Ephemeral. An ephemeral log is a contradiction, but I like contradictions.

This is a log of things both real and imaginary.

It may include updates from my adventures in cyberspace (aka. videogames) as well as random tidbits from my hobbies, random ravings (writing), and photographs of the world I imagine myself to live in.

# What is this actually?

1. This is a selection of Markdown files from my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notebook that I am using the [Obsidian Digital Garden Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) to publish to the web.
2. This is a consolidation of all of my old blogs into a simpler format that is easier for me to maintain.

Really this is just random junk that either:
 - I thought might be useful to people online. (Documentation)
 - I thought people online might actually enjoy.
 - Longer forms of stuff I posted to social media but couldn't fit.
 - Nonsense I want the Universe to know, even if it doesn't care.

# But who am I?
"He's just this guy, you know?"
 - Computer Nerd
 - Would-be Builder of Robots, Games and Animatronics
 - Gen X
 - Only Child
 - Classic and New Doctor Who Fan
 - Father
 - Survivor and Escapee from Religion

## Background
Computers have been my hobby and passion since childhood. My hobby is to experiment with computers.

## Career Background
 - I have been a Full Stack Web Developer for about five years specializing in automation of business processes.
 - I was a Unix System Admin for ten years before that.
 - Before that I did Desktop Support for about five years. 
 - And back in the days of yore I helped run a small ISP.
 - In short, I am a jack of all (computer) trades, and master of none.
