I am using GitHub Discussions to wrangle feedback for my site. My GitHub is also a good place to see what else I am doing and find more direct contact information if you need it.

If you want to leave a comment about this site or ask a question please post something here by starting a new discussion or adding to an existing one:

If you see a real error in one of my pages, especially knowledge base type pages, feel free to open an Issue here:
https://github.com/chrisl8/VoidshipEphemeralLog/issues

I'm also on Mastodon
